# play-scala-data-reporting

Part 8 of the GCP Goodies Series

## Running

export your JSON GCP service account credentials:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/[FILE_NAME].json"
```

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from <http://www.playframework.com/download> then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```bash
sbt run
```

And then go to <http://localhost:9000> to see the running web application.
